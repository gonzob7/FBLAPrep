 Installation
-------------
 **In order to install this application a Mac running Xcode with CocoaPods will be needed.**
 1. Make sure CocoaPods is installed on the development computer. Install Guide can be found here: https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html
 2. Close your Xcode project before you carry out the following steps.
 3. Next type `cd` and drag and drop the project directory into the terminal window.
 4. Press return
 5. Next type `pod install`
 6. Once installed, open the archive and click on `FBLA101.xcworkspace` (make sure its the one with the white blue print!)
 7.  Once the project is loaded, select a device from the drop-down near the top-left corner (This can be a simulator or a real device)
 8. Once a device is selected, press the icon that is very similar to a play button to run the project.
 9. If running on an actual device, make sure to accept any prompts so the app builds correctly. You also may need to go to Settings -> General -> Profile & Device Management -> Look under 'Developer Apps' -> Accept FBLA101<br>
**Note:** If running on a device, make sure it is unlocked before it is plugged in.


Signing Fix
-------------
After downloading the .zip file you will most likely need to change the signing settings of the app.
 1. Click 'FBLA101' at the top of the left sidebar with the blue project blueprint icon to the left of it.
 2. If done correctly, a new window will open. From the left sidebar of that window (you might have to click on it if it's hidden), look for 'FBLA101' under 'Targets' and click it.
 3. Under 'General' look for 'Signing' and fix any signing issues by selecting/creating your own team. You may have to enter your Apple ID during this step.
