 Installation
-------------
 **In order to install this application a Mac running Xcode with CocoaPods will be needed.**

 2. Open the archive and click on `FBLA101.xcworkspace` make sure its the white-colored blueprint icon!
 3.  Once the project is loaded, select a device from the drop-down near the top-left corner (This can be a simulator (only iPhone 6,7,8!) or a real device)
 4. Once a device is selected, press the icon that is very similar to a play button to run the project.
 5. If running on an actual device, make sure to accept any prompts so the app builds correctly. You also may need to go to Settings -> General -> Profile & Device Management -> Look under 'Developer Apps' -> Accept FBLA101<br>
**Note:** If running on a device, make sure it is unlocked before it is plugged in.


Signing Fix

After downloading the .zip file you will most likely need to change the signing settings of the app.
 1. Click 'FBLA101' at the top of the left sidebar with the blue project blueprint icon to the left of it.
 2. If done correctly, a new window will open. From the left sidebar of that window (you might have to click on it if it's hidden), look for 'FBLA101' under 'Targets' and click it.
 3. Under 'General' look for 'Signing' and fix any signing issues by selecting/creating your own team. You may have to enter your Apple ID during this step.
